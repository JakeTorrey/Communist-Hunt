Our code is run from the background class. Background calls the game class which does most of the stuff that you will see in the game.
we use a couple different listeners to allow our menu to work. The stalin class creates the images that are meant to be shot. for our
end game we have a class that writes over the curretn JFrame and ends the game showing accuracy.
